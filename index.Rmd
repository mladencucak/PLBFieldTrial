This repository is part of results of my PhD project.  
Here I present the results of the field trial, set up to evaluate the opportunities for the IPM of potato late blight under Irish conditions.  
Here we looked into potential for using the environmental disease risk prediction, varietal resistance and monitoring the pathogen population for the reduction of the pesticide usage.

 
**The open-access publication of the manuscript the preciding work on the evaluation of the IR, potato late blight risk model used in Ireland, can be found** [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/9/9/515).
The accompanying compeduim with open access to the code is [here.](https://mladencucak.github.io/AnalysisPLBIreland/)

  
  The repository is built on the example research compendium provided by Emerson Del Ponte [here](https://github.com/emdelponte/research-compendium-website).

The funding for this project comes from [DAFM (Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine)](https://www.agriculture.gov.ie). 

## Notes 

Some code chunks are folded and they can be accessed by clicking on the arrow (The code).  
Try not to have other R sessions running because it could produce problems installing libraries.  
If there are any problems reproducing the analysis, please raise an issue on GitHub.
